# Example webservers

There are going to be a lot of webservers in here over time.  Some of them are here to show
steps in basic usage; others are here to show features or approaches.



# Intro servers

If you're new to `htstub`, please consider reading and using these webservers first, in this order:

1. [hello_world](hello_world.erl), a simple flat string server.
1. [magic_8_ball](magic_8_ball.erl), an introduction to basic dynamic pages.
1. [json_chess](json_chess.erl), a simple GET json api example for chess.
1. [post_store](post_store.erl), a tiny (and unsafe) storage engine for POST data.
1. [cache_away](cache_away.erl), an introduction to writing middleware using caching as an example.
1. [sms_web](sms_web.erl), a trivial twilio api usage to show simple bridging behavior.
