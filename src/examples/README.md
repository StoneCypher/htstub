# Example webservers

There are going to be a lot of webservers in here over time.  Some of them are here to show
steps in basic usage; others are here to show features or approaches.



# Intro servers

If you're new to `htstub`, please consider reading and using these webservers first, in this order:

1. [hello_world_ws](hello_world_ws.erl), a simple flat string server.
1. [magic_8_ball](magic_8_ball.erl), an introduction to basic dynamic pages.
